## Components
**SpaceShip -** Shoot the asteroids that fall from the sky, avoid them.
## The changes i made: 
1) Added hit points to the player (3 hit points till game over).
2) Original change is dropping a bomb (slower speed and less spawn),
  if the player grabs it - there's a big explosion and all enemies are dead.
